  "descriptionShort" : "Our app is designed to help you measure the risk of fasting in patients with diabetes according to the IDF-DAR 2021.",
  "descriptionLong" : "Fasting is the practice of abstaining from food and drink for a period of time. While this practice is associated with several health benefits, it can also lead to complications, especially in patients with diabetes.\n\nDiabetes is a chronic disease characterized by elevated blood sugar levels. This elevation can lead to serious complications, particularly at the cardiovascular, renal and ophthalmic levels.\n\nTherefore, before undertaking a fast, it is important to measure the risk that this represents for diabetic patients. It is in this context that our application was developed.\n\nOur application is accessible to everyone and easy to use. It allows users to enter information about their medical profile, including diabetes type, duration of diabetes, hypoglycemia, glycemic control, macrovascular complications and comorbidities, renal complications and comorbidities, pregnancy, frailty and cognitive function, as well as their previous experience and duration of fasting.\n\nOnce this information is entered, the application calculates the patient's risk of fasting based on the IDF-DAR. The result is presented as a message, which allows users to easily understand the level of risk associated with fasting.\n\nFinally, our app is regularly updated with the latest scientific data and IDF-DAR recommendations. This ensures that users have the most up-to-date information to assess their fasting risk and make informed health decisions.\n\nIn summary, our app is a valuable tool to help patients with diabetes assess the risk of fasting and make informed health decisions. It is easy to use, accessible to everyone and based on sound scientific data. We are confident that this application will be of great help to diabetic patients and healthcare professionals.\n\nAll recommendations presented in this application are taken from the IDF-DAR 2021 guidelines.",
